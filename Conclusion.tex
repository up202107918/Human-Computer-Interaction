\chapter*{Conclusion}
Concluding our first report we want to emphasize the many lives and goods that can be saved and protected by the streamlining of detection and prevention systems like the one we tried to sketch. During the Portuguese wildfires of 2024 it surely would have been of great value to have had one such system in place to detect the fires that broke out during those nights. Furthermore, we would like to emphasize that an important task such as protecting society canâ€™t indeed be trivialized and watered down so that it requires very little prior knowledge of the tools used. Much can still be improved to make the user experience even more accurate to the desired goal for our project, but we are proud of the ideas we collected and worked upon so that we will be able to make a prototype of our system.
