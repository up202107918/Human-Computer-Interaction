\subsection{Cognitive Walk}
In order to make sure that our dashboard was suitable 
to the stakeholders mentioned in Section 2, we went 
through a cognitive walkthrough, which was divided in 
three charges: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Outside the Group
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Analyser --> Someone from another project group 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Inside the Group
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Observer --> Writes down the analyser's performance
    \item Facilitator --> Explains the procedures to the 
    analyser
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize} \par 
For the analyser part, we ended up with not one, but two 
analysers, whose names are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Francisco Passos
    \item Vicente Torres
\end{itemize} \par
Each analyser was given two missions: "An alarming levels 
alert shows up. Verify." and "There is a fire taking place 
in Albergaria-a-Velha. Investigate.". Each mission was ranked 
from 0 to 2 (from "Bad" to "Great"), according to the 
analyser's performance.

    \item Conclusions 
    \item Changes
