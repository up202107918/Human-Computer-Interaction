\chapter{Introduction} \label{intro}
As time goes by, we come to the conclusion that wildfires are 
some of the most fierce and dangerous threats to human and 
wildlife safety. One of the ways to prevent them is by using 
technological tools that can detect and combat them more 
effectively. \par 
For this report, we divided all of the stages of our project 
into four sections: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Section 1: from the problem description to the 
    definition of stakeholders;
    \item Section 2: from the designed sketches to the iteration 
    process.
\end{itemize}
